        "description": "This villa represents a traditional typology of the Albanian houses based on its organization,‘banese me qoshk’. Massive walls made of a traditional technique with mud ‘qerpici’, 40cm  thickness. There’s a simetric division of the main inner spaces and as a result it’s thought to have been used, through the years by two brothers. Today this house, doesn’t exist anymore even though represented one of the oldest typology of houses from Tirana and in its place there’s a high-rise building construction project going on.",

        "description": "Villa ‘Fortuzi’ was built from Omer Fortuzi around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families of the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana, while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with its big, functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an ‘L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period.",

        "description": "The first Cinema in Tirana, also known as Cinema-Theater ‘Nacional’ project realized by the architect Skënder Luarasi, in  1924. It represented a very important cultural center at the time and gathering place for the cities inhabitants. In 1945 took the name ’17 nëntori’ (the date of Tirana’s Independence). It was used as a cinema until 1991 (during which its ownership changed from the ‘Beshiret’ family to the Government).It was dominated by three high arches that sustained the projection cabin. The entrance was resolved with a certain simplicity and showed the professional skills of the author. The main hall was small and the black marble coverings had a certain calming effect. From there, you could walk in the ‘platea’ auditorium or go upstairs to the ‘logias’ . The main cinema hall was well proportioned and with optimal auditive and visual parameters. On the right side were the doors to the exit. There was also a summer cinema that was very well connected with that winter cinema hall. It was the most luxurious Cinema in the capital during the king's regime and during the occupation also.  Later on, some popular courts were held in its inner space and after that, it was used for spiritual sessions etc, until it decayed completely and it was given to its original owners back again, but it never returned back to being a cinema again. Finally in 2003, the decision to completely demolish it, was taken and instead of it, a 'Shopping mall'was erected. In the beginning, it was said to save and re-use the existing façade of the building but afterwards this idea wasn’t implemented. Everything from the old Cinema vanished as it apparently never existed, the only thing remaining the same was its name .",

        "description": "Pallati me Kuba also known from locals as Kadare’s Palace (where illustrious families like the ones of D.Agolli and I.Kadare have been living for several years) and which in architectural professional circles is considered as one of the first iniciators of the ‘ modernist’ era in Tirana. Therefore it was labeled as an intentioned provocation to the official Communist art of the time. Also the building’s volumetri was perceived as with clear orientation towards ‘Kubism’ in a visible contrast with the gloomy socialist architecture preveling that periode. Today, eventhough it stands in one of the most visible spots of the city center, its condition provokes a state of compassion, an eyesore, where each sign of the time passing-by, is sufficiently visible from the lack of plaster in the  main facades to the illegal adjanted  spaces on the groundfloor etc. A structure that once provoked so much reaction, today stays completely ignored and neglected. Its architect is Maks Velo",
