        "description": "Villa 'Fortuzi' was built from Omer Fortuzi around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families of the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana, while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with its big, functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an 'L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period.",

            "description": "Toptani’s Sarajet have been built around 1833-1840, one of the least buildings realized during the feudal period, in Albania. It possesses a space of around 32 rooms, all decorated in oriental style. It represents a very important architectural complex constructed with massive bearing walls made out of qerpic and antisismic wooden wall beams, that give to it the feeling of a fortification or fortress. This being a type of  building and construction technique spread in Albania during the second half of the 19th century, during the feudal order. It’s a two storey building, listed as a  Monument of Culture, built with traditional techniques from old masters from Diber. It has special values not only for thenner functional organization but also for its architectural treatment and decorations. It's exterior is treated with simplicity, plain and clear volumetry with a white facade and some wooden decorative windows. It has an abundant garden space in front, with a well and the entire complex is surrounded by high walls with a principle gate. During A.Zogu's regime it was used as The National Library and further on during Communism it served as the officies of the Institute of Monuments and Culture (it is believed around 1963).  Its ownership returned back to its original owners and for awhile was used as a Bar/restaurant, despite this today stands not functional and non-accessible to the public.",

               "description": "This Villa is a Monument of second category. Represents the first mediatic Institution in Albania. The villa was built  in 1938 from a very rich and important family of Tirana 'Kollciu’ with the main purpose to be a house for two brothers, fact  that is  also emphasized by the symmetric plan organization of the villa. Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for 'Radio Tirana’ until 1965. After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the 'rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them 'squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed. Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation, some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .

Therefore this facade is slightly more closed than the main one. You can clearly notice the richness with which the facade was treated, decorative frames around the windows and doors, in the two floors divisions and decorative plaster elements on the wall-corners.",

                         "description": "This house is located on 'Kolonel Thomson' street, near the Amphitheater of Durres. It represents the house typology with 'çardak', built during the second half of the 19th century. Around the 30s of the 20th century it served as the head-center of the English Consulate and today serves as 'The Ethnographic Museum of Durres'. This is the house where the actor 'Aleksander Moisiu' grew up, an important figure of the scenic art in Europe, born to an Albanian father and an Italian mother. Two of today's Ethnographic Museum spaces are dedicated to him. Meanwhile, the other three spaces have been dedicated to the local artisan development and values, of the city and its localities. The house is organized in two floors, it has an external stone staircase that enables the connection of the ground floor with the second floor's 'çardak'( a kind of open portico used in the Albanian vernacular architecture). This staircase is sustained by stone vaults, that rest upon a stone archway. 'Çardaku' is confined, along the main facade, by wooden pillars and also paved with wood. It's restoration happened in 1983. ",

                            "description": "This 80-year-old building is otherwise known as the 'King Zog's Villa' and is positioned in a very dominant location, 98 meters above sea level, from where the whole city of Durres can be seen from the three main sides of its eagle-shaped structure. It is thought to have been built in 1927 as a personal gift to King Zog I, from the business community of Durres in a sign of respect and appreciation. The architect of this house is thought to be Prof. Kristo Sotiri, a laureate in Padua and Venice (Italy), who also had an eleven-year experience as the architect of the court of Queen Elizabeth Carmen Silva of Romania. He designed and built one of the most unique villas of the city, that referring to the detailed level of indoor and outdoor decorations and materiality can be seen as a kind of royal palace. The building took its final form in 1937 under the care of Italian architects and specialists, a few months before the Monarch Zog the I'st marriage to the Hungarian Countess, Geraldine. The interiors are gracefully decorated, with a stunning parquet floor and a characteristic, walnut-decorated ceiling. The upper floor is specially designed for the royal couple with balconies that overlook the entire bay of Durres, a testament to a modern building of this period. This villa is quite famous for its different kinds of marble and its grand saloon. Over the years the villa has served for more than 40 years as a waiting residence for various names of the Communist Party, starting from Hrushov to the Cambodian prince, and its most notable host after the 1990s has been the former US President, Jimmy Carter. The building was also used in communist-era for parties and weddings. The building with special architecture was badly damaged in march of 1997, during the collapse created by the pyramid firms, when within two days it was vandalized, stolen, completely destroying the lighting system, which had remained intact since the time it was built. For several years it was used by the international NATO forces, arriving on military missions.",
