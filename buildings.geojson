            "description": "The Villa is positioned in the intersection of ‘Rruga Kont Urani’ and 'Rruga Kavajes' once known as Boulevard ‘Mussolini’ using a surface area of 1437m2. This project was realized in 1935 but the construction works lasted until 1936, from the Italian engenieer Giulio Berte (whome is a very important name in the history of the architecture of Tirana, the one who realized The Palace of Brigades, once ‘The Royal Villa’ and  the design of the Scanderbeg Square in Tirana). This villa was commissioned by the once mayor of the Municipality of Tirana, Abedin Nepravishta ( Mayor from 1934-1936, and 1937-1939). This project was thought to have influenced King Zogu to ask Berte to realize also the project for his residence villa, ‘Royal Villa’ very notable today because of some similirities in terms of their design. Like many other Italian architects of that time G.Berte also intended a rational style with a representative character not realated to the existing architecture of the surrounding but  providing a certain combination of modernity and identity of the context also respecting specific urban conditions towards the main streets. Being a villa situated  in a crossroad of two very important mobility axes, it’s volumetry as a result was very defined and geometric, at the same time monumental providing a view towards the ‘Mussolini’ Boulevard, ‘Ethem Bej Mosque’ and further on to the main ‘Scanderbeg Square’. It has a very clear plan organizations, with an underground plan, ground floor plan, first floor and terrace. Talking about the functional organization , its ground floor was meant to host mixed use spaces.Thre  main areas along the Boulevard Mussolini , treated like duplexes with specific staircases connecting to the first floor and  the technical  spaces underground. The other part of the ground floor plan was reserved for  an apartment  that communicated also to the inner garden. Meanwhile all the first floor has a residential use therefore represents a more intimate space. Its structural system is a compound one with  perimetral massive walls of 30-45cm and inner reinforced concrete beam-column system.From 1945 until 1992 it served as a Kindergraden  and after 1992 the original owners got it back.",

        "description": "Villa ‘Fortuzi’ was built from Omer Fortuzi around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families of the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana, while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with its big, functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an ‘L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period.",

            "description": "Toptani’s Sarajet have been built around 1833-1840, one of the least buildings realized during the feudal period, in Albania. It possesses a space of around 32 rooms, all decorated in oriental style. It represents a very important architectural complex constructed with massive bearing walls made out of qerpic and antisismic wooden wall beams, that give to it the feeling of a fortification or fortress. This being a type of  building and construction technique spread in Albania during the second half of the 19th century, during the feudal order. It’s a two storey building, listed as a  Monument of Culture, built with traditional techniques from old masters from Diber. It has special values not only for thenner functional organization but also for its architectural treatment and decorations. It's exterior is treated with simplicity, plain and clear volumetry with a white facade and some wooden decorative windows. It has an abundant garden space in front, with a well and the entire complex is surrounded by high walls with a principle gate. During A.Zogu's regime it was used as The National Library and further on during Communism it served as the officies of the Institute of Monuments and Culture (it is believed around 1963).  Its ownership returned back to its original owners and for awhile was used as a Bar/restaurant, despite this today stands not functional and non-accessible to the public.",

               "description": "This Villa is a Monument of second category. Represents the first mediatic Institution in Albania. The villa was built  in 1938 from a very rich and important family of Tirana ‘Kollciu’ with the main purpose to be a house for two brothers, fact  that is  also emphasized by the symmetric plan organization of the villa. Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for ‘Radio Tirana’ until 1965. After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the ‘rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them ‘squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed. Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation, some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .
