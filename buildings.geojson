        "description": "Villa 'Fortuzi' was built from Omer Fortuzi around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families of the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana, while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with its big, functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an 'L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period.",

            "description": "Toptani’s Sarajet have been built around 1833-1840, one of the least buildings realized during the feudal period, in Albania. It possesses a space of around 32 rooms, all decorated in oriental style. It represents a very important architectural complex constructed with massive bearing walls made out of qerpic and antisismic wooden wall beams, that give to it the feeling of a fortification or fortress. This being a type of  building and construction technique spread in Albania during the second half of the 19th century, during the feudal order. It’s a two storey building, listed as a  Monument of Culture, built with traditional techniques from old masters from Diber. It has special values not only for thenner functional organization but also for its architectural treatment and decorations. It's exterior is treated with simplicity, plain and clear volumetry with a white facade and some wooden decorative windows. It has an abundant garden space in front, with a well and the entire complex is surrounded by high walls with a principle gate. During A.Zogu's regime it was used as The National Library and further on during Communism it served as the officies of the Institute of Monuments and Culture (it is believed around 1963).  Its ownership returned back to its original owners and for awhile was used as a Bar/restaurant, despite this today stands not functional and non-accessible to the public.",

               "description": "This Villa is a Monument of second category. Represents the first mediatic Institution in Albania. The villa was built  in 1938 from a very rich and important family of Tirana 'Kollciu’ with the main purpose to be a house for two brothers, fact  that is  also emphasized by the symmetric plan organization of the villa. Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for 'Radio Tirana’ until 1965. After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the 'rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them 'squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed. Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation, some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .

Therefore this facade is slightly more closed than the main one. You can clearly notice the richness with which the facade was treated, decorative frames around the windows and doors, in the two floors divisions and decorative plaster elements on the wall-corners.",

It represents the house typology with 'çardak', built during the second half of the 19th century. Around the 30s of the 20th century it served as the head-center of the English Consulate and today serves as 'The Ethnographic Museum of Durres'. This is the house where the actor 'Aleksander Moisiu' grew up, an important figure of the scenic art in Europe, born to an Albanian father and an Italian mother. Two of today's Ethnographic Museum spaces are dedicated to him. Meanwhile, the other three spaces have been dedicated to the local artisan development and values, of the city and its localities. The house is organized in two floors, it has an external stone staircase that enables the connection of the ground floor with the second floor's 'çardak'( a kind of open portico used in the Albanian vernacular architecture). This staircase is sustained by stone vaults, that rest upon a stone archway. 'Çardaku' is confined, along the main facade, by wooden pillars and also paved with wood. It's restoration happened in 1983. ",

                            "description": "This 80-year-old building is otherwise known as the 'King Zog's Villa' and is positioned in a very dominant location, 98 meters above sea level, from where the whole city of Durres can be seen from the three main sides of its eagle-shaped structure. It is thought to have been built in 1927 as a personal gift to King Zog I, from the business community of Durres in a sign of respect and appreciation. The architect of this house is thought to be Prof. Kristo Sotiri, a laureate in Padua and Venice (Italy), who also had an eleven-year experience as the architect of the court of Queen Elizabeth Carmen Silva of Romania. He designed and built one of the most unique villas of the city, that referring to the detailed level of indoor and outdoor decorations and materiality can be seen as a kind of royal palace. The building took its final form in 1937 under the care of Italian architects and specialists, a few months before the Monarch Zog the I'st marriage to the Hungarian Countess, Geraldine. The interiors are gracefully decorated, with a stunning parquet floor and a characteristic, walnut-decorated ceiling. The upper floor is specially designed for the royal couple with balconies that overlook the entire bay of Durres, a testament to a modern building of this period. This villa is quite famous for its different kinds of marble and its grand saloon. Over the years the villa has served for more than 40 years as a waiting residence for various names of the Communist Party, starting from Hrushov to the Cambodian prince, and its most notable host after the 1990s has been the former US President, Jimmy Carter. The building was also used in communist-era for parties and weddings. The building with special architecture was badly damaged in march of 1997, during the collapse created by the pyramid firms, when within two days it was vandalized, stolen, completely destroying the lighting system, which had remained intact since the time it was built. For several years it was used by the international NATO forces, arriving on military missions.",

                               "description": "Located in the village of Bujan, this house was proclaimed a monument on January 8, 1977. The house is of the 'fortified' typology typical of the area of Gjakova with many other features of this typology. This house is organized on three floors where the ground floor is not for living but in the service of livestock also known as 'ahri', while the first floor is In the village of Bujan, in the south-eastern part district of Tropoja, on a high ground rises the 'Tower of Mic Sokolit'. The collapsed walls of the tower, hit many times by the cannons of the foreign invaders, are evidence of the people's resistance and struggle to protect their lands. It is not known exactly when this tower was built, but it is thought about at the end of the 18th century. In addition to the historical value of the figure it relates to, it is of particular importance for the house-typology it represents in the highlands of Gjakova. As a result of a fire in 1945, it has been massively destroyed, losing its floors and roof structure. The tower is made out of three storeys and has a rectangular plan with right angles. The composition scheme of space distribution is as follows: on the ground floor there is' ahri ', on the first-floor women's room, preceded by a hallway, and on the second floor 'divanhania' and the 'guest room'. The connection of all these spaces is realized with wooden stairs inside and outside. 'Ahri' served as a shelter for livestock and horses and had a protective function as one of the safest spaces in all dwellings of this typology. At the perimeter of the tower, there are from one to two 'frengjij' in small dimensions, on each site providing minimal ventilation and illumination, which makes the tower safer. The door is on the north side and is covered with arches. The door is secured from the inside with a wooden beam called 'drang' which is inserted into the open hole in the right part of the masonry wall. <br/>The ground floor of the tower consisted of a single room, the women's room (soba e grave) or 'fire chamber'(oda e zjarrit), the entrance to which was secured by a door on its western side with a single exterior ramp-staircase. Conclusions derived from some traces left on the masonry before restoration. The door, like that in the 'ahri', was covered with a stone-made arch, this one wood-panel door, also secured with the 'drang' element. From the vertical footprint of a column, on the east side of the wall, was deduced and assumed that there was the beginning of a wooden skeleton partition of the women's room with a corridor leading to the sanitary unit. Regarding the women's room environment, it was illuminated and ventilated through some small windows, arched outwards and next to them on each side of this room were 2-3 'frengjij'. On the south side of the Tower are found traces of a chimney, thought to be of a 'tambur' type, with a rectangular, right-angle section. <br />The second floor of the tower: This floor is also the most damaged but due to the importance of careful reading of the footprints, it has been possible to reconstruct the floor layout. This floor contained in its interior the 'guest room' which was preceded by another space 'divanhania', on a smaller surface than the 'guest room' and separated from it, and an interconnected corridor through the 'dyshekllek ' (structure with vertical columns of wood blinded with thick wooden planks). The wooden stairs on the 'divanhane' connects this floor to the 1st floor. The interconnecting corridor of these two spaces leads to the sanitary unit in the eastern part. The perimeter walls on this floor, as in the other two, are limestone masonry walls. The upper-floor restoration was even more difficult as only two walls had resisted.<br/>This building was of double importance for restoration, both historically, as the birthplace of the hero Mic Sokoli, and from the typological point of view of the tower-houses of this area, but at the same time it was very difficult to restore and to decide to restore it since a considerate amount of the object's elements were missing and demolished. The way it was dealt with, was that first consolidation actions were made on the existing walls and also the rebuilding of parts of the tower for which there were traces of their existence. Their reconstruction increased the stability of the existing structure, as with the re-creation of the 'dyshekllek'. The use of typological analogies with other elements of this type of house from the region did not allow for error. Outdoor wooden stairs, horse 'ahri', and the entire interior with lime plaster were also recreated. The 'dyshekllek' was realized as it was always made with oak wood with 8cm timber and more open windows. The roof is made of 'stropil' type and covered with 'furde' (wooden planks) and its bottoms are rounded. The volumetry of the tower represents a prismatic body made of stone and wooden elements, covered with a four-direction inclination wooden roof. The tower was restored within the framework of the 100th anniversary of 'Lidhja Prizrenit', and after its restoration, it became a museum-house about the life and activity of Mic Sokoli.",

The space used to isolate a person who had committed a crime, waiting for the reconciliation through the intervention of the group of wise and old men of the village. In terms of volume and architecture, it represents a typical and simple example, of a tower-house of this province of Albania, fortified with massive stone walls, each facade very closed in the outside, with the exception of a few small openings also known as ''frengjij''. The structure indicates the protective character of this house. The entrance gate is embedded with arched stone cover and all of its groundfloors is build upon a rock, still visible, element that shows this strong respect and connection of this architecture with the context, with nature.",

It is built on a steep cliff, 9m high and it stands connected in a very organic way with the terrain, looking like a further extension of it. This tower-house has a horizontal extension with a surface around 87m2. Its ground floor was used to accommodate the livestock, so it is slightly lower as a floor with the main entrance, on its main facade. A specific characteristic of this house is the entrance to the second living floor, through a covered staircase made of stone, creating, therefore, a sort of covered protected entrance, that at its higher level is open to the view of the surrounding mountains. The upper floor has two main rooms, one where the main family used to live and the other one, organized on a higher level is the 'guest room', containing a hearth also, wooden pavement and wooden ceiling. Being a tower-house, it doesn't have many openings and windows so two of its facades are completely closed and on one of its corners, a 'frengjij'(small openings on a masonry wall, realized for enemy protection reasons) can be noticed, since it stands out in volumetry.",

There lived two families, who later migrated and currently, for more than 20 years the house stands completely deserted. The two facades of this house contain anthropometric features, a sign that shows their human character.",
